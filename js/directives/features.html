           <p class="lead">Graduating from Brigham Young University with a degree in Psychology, I knew I wanted to make an impact on the world. 3 months after graduation, I went to DevMountain, a coding bootcamp, to start my dreams: I can make a bigger impact, reach more people and express my creativity without constraints. I've truly fallen in love with web development.</p>

         <p class="lead">I've always been fascinated with learning new things. New challenges intrigue me. Being this way leads me to explore, whether that be traversing new heights or broadening my paradigm and ideas in life. From athletics to academia, I try to dream big and excel in all. A major vision of mine is to own my own company that will make an impact on peoples lives.</p>

         <p class="lead">From Lord of the Rings and Zelda to Sports and dance parties, I can find common ground with anyone. I have found that people become friends from relatability. We all have at least one thing in common: being human. One of my mottos growing up has been "help me help you". Humans just want to love and be loved. Kindness goes a long ways</p>

         <p class="lead">I am an firm believer in God and Jesus Christ. They are my anchors in life. There are many contending voices in this life, but only one pierces the heart and dispels every fear. "Man may deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception..., but one touch with the finger of his love, yes, one ray of glory from the upper world, or one word from the mouth of the Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into insignificance, and blots it forever from the mind." —Messenger and Advocate, vol. 1 (October 1834), pp. 14—16</p>
